- The goal is to integrate this element into more elements.

## MOIL Fisheye Image Processing on Renesas RZ/G2L
- This chapter discusses the implementation of MOIL fisheye image processing technology on the Renesas RZ/G2L hardware platform.
 
## Development and Deployment Strategy
- Initial development and testing are performed on a PC to leverage better development and runtime performance.
- After development, the application is deployed to the Renesas RZ/G2L hardware through cross-platform compilation.

# Objective
- The main objective is to implement MOIL image processing technology on the Renesas RZ/G2L.
- Enable image streaming over a network.
- Facilitate further system development on a PC or other hardware environments.
